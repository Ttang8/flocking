## About

Visual simulation of birds flocking using the Boids model.

Use sliders to change intensities of alignment, cohesion, and separation.

Birds will avoid the mouse as an custom added boundary.

## Boids Model

Simulates the flocking of birds. Follows 3 rules:

### Alignment

Steer towards the average heading of local flockmates.

### Cohesion

Steer to move towards the average position (center of mass) of local flockmates.

### Separation

Steer to avoid crowding local flockmates.
